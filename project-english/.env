# Google Drive API Configuration
# Get these credentials from Google Cloud Console:
# 1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 2. Create a new project or select an existing one
# 3. Enable the Google Drive API
# 4. Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID and API Key)

# Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID for authentication
# Required for Google Drive sign-in functionality
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=330597757388-cdngesnvlcn7uiev2ptar27bu1gco9bt.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Google Drive API Key for file operations
# Required for Google Drive API access
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDQONqrEK8FmTVj2ci8AM-DMmBKFMMZz20

# Instructions:
# 1. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Google API credentials
# 2. Make sure .env is in your .gitignore file to keep credentials secure

# Additional Notes:
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to expose these variables to the client
# - Keep these credentials secure and never commit them to version control
# - For production, use environment variables on your hosting platform
